### Why make a new model when you can update one you already have?

In OpenMx, models can be modified. Want to add a new path? Go ahead - no need to start from scratch.

You can add, or remove anything, re-run, and compare.

This tutorial will cover using umxModify to update models.

## Build and Run: An overview

```r
manifests = c("mpg", "disp", "gear")
m1 <- umxRAM("big_motor_bad_mpg",
	umxPath(c("disp", "gear"), to = "mpg"),
	umxPath("disp", with = "gear"),
	umxPath(var = "mpg"),
	umxPath(var = "disp", fixedAt = var(mtcars$disp)),
	umxPath(var = "gear", fixedAt = var(mtcars$gear)),
	data = mxData(cov(mtcars[,manifests]), type = "cov", numObs = nrow(mtcars))
)

# Now show a summary.
umxSummary(m1, show = "both")

```

## Modify a model

[Fundamentally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model), modeling is in the service of understanding causality and we do that primarily via model comparison: Better theories fit the data better than do worse theories.

So, "do more gears give better miles per gallon"?

In graph terms, this is asking, "is the path from to gear to mpg significant?" There are two ways to test this with umx.

### Removing a path

1. Overwrite existing paths, fixing a value to zero.

```r
m2 = mxModel(m1, mxPath(from = "gear", to = "mpg", free = F, values = 0)
m2 = mxRun(m2)
```
```r
umxCompare(m1, m2)
```

2. Use a label and umxModify()

By default, umxModify fixes the value of matched labels to zero.

```r
m2 = umxModify(m1, update = "gear_to_mpg", name = "no effect of gear")
```

`umxModify()` can modify, run, and compare all in 1-line

```r
	m2 = umxModify(m1, update = "gear_to_mpg", name = "drop effect of gear"), comparison = TRUE)
```


`umxModify` Is a convenience function to add, set, or drop parameters, re-name, and re-run a model. Its main benefit is compactness. 

For example, this one-liner drops a path labelled "Cs", tests the effect, and returns the updated model

```r
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "Cs", name = "newModelName", comparison = T) 
```
A powerful feature of umxModify is regular expressions. These let you drop collections of paths by matching patterns. So, 

```r
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "Cs_r1_c[0-9].", regex = TRUE, name = "drop_all_cols_of_row1_of_Cs", comparison = T)
```
Will drop all paths with labels matching  "Cs_r1_c" followed by any other digits. i.e., all columns of row 1.

### Parameters of umxModify

In addition to the `lastFit` parameter (the mxModel you wish to update and re-run), umxModify takes the following options:

`update` specifies what to update before re-running. It can be a list of labels, a regular expression (set regex = T) or an object such as an `mxCI` (mx confidence interval request).

```r
# 1. update by matching a label
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "Cs", name = "newModelName") 

# 2. update by matching a regular expression
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "C[sr]", regex = TRUE, name = "drop_Cs_andCr")

# 3. update by passing in a new object to be added to the model
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = mxCI("Cs"), name = "withCI")
```
### free and value

By default, matched labels will be dropped, i.e., "free = F value = 0"

Set "free = TRUE" to free a variable. Set "value = X" to set the value of the matched paths to value X	

`freeToStart`: Whether to only update parameters based on their current free-state. defaults to NA - i.e, not checked.

### confidence Intervals

As in mxRun, you can set `intervals` = TRUE to run confidence intervals (see mxRun)

### comparison

To run `umxCompare`() and report on the old and new models, just set "comparison = TRUE"

```r
# 1. Run the new model
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "Cs", name = "newModelName") 

# 2. R model, and compare to the lastFit
fit2 = umxModify(fit1, update = "Cs", name = "newModelName", comparison = T) 
```
