```r
require(umx)
data(demoOneFactor)

manifests = names(demoOneFactor)
m1 = umxRAM("OneFactor", data = demoOneFactor, type = "cov",
	umxPath("G", to = manifests),
	umxPath(var = manifests),
	umxPath(var = "G", fixedAt = 1)
)

```
	
### Add raw data and compute factor scores

```r

# Swap in raw data in place of summary data
m2 = mxModel(m1, mxData(demoOneFactor, type = "raw"))

# Estimate factor scores for the model
fs = mxFactorScores(m2, 'Regression')

```

### Create some missing data and compute factor scores

All the data-points of demoOneFactor are present:

```r
all(complete.cases(demoOneFactor))
# [1] TRUE
```

Letâ€™s delete 10% from each column at random:

```r
df = demoOneFactor
n = dim(df)[1];
for (i in dim(df)[2]) {
	df[sample(n, .1 * n), i] = NA
}
all(complete.cases(df))
```

Run again with the missing data:

```r

m2 <- mxModel(m1, mxData(df, type = "raw"))
# Estimate factor scores for the model
fs = mxFactorScores(m2, 'Regression')

```

Just saved yourself $1000 buying Mplus for factor scores with missing data!
