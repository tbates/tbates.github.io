### What we you have seen how to do:
1. Build & Run `umxRAM` models
3. Get `umxSummary` output
4. `plot` model diagrams
5. `umxCompare` models
6. Modify models
 * Drop paths
 * Equate paths by label

### umx function list
We've used:

* umxRAM
* umxPath
* umxSummary
* plot
* umxReRun
* mxModel
* mxPath

# Congratulations!

### What's in store?

You can learn about mapths, models, plot, summary in more detail in the [advanced collection](/container/tutorial/2040/06/18/container-More-advanced-RAM-articles.html).

We'll also cover:
1. Multiple groups
2. Twin models: umxACE, umxCP, umxIP, umxGxE
3. Factor scores (with missing data!)
4. Ordinal and Binary data
5. WLS
6. Modification indices
7. Confidence intervals
8. Specific model types
 * Mimic?
 * Simplex?
 * Bi-factor?
9. Lower-level helpers
