<p style="text-align: center;">This is a gallery of example models. To learn about installing umx, or take a basic tutorial, start at home page.</p>


*note*: This page expresses the goal for umx's coverage of core  copy-and-paste templates. It's not done :-).

### Three basic methods of modeling supported in OpenMx
* umxPath
* matrix-based

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis
* One factor models
* Multiple factor models
* Ordinal factor analysis
* Joint ordinal/continuous factor analysis

### SEM, indirect effects, mediation analysis
* Regression with structural equation models
* Ordinal regression
* Mediation
* Moderation

### Measurement models and Psychometrics
<!-- * Item response theory -->
<!-- * Item factor analysis -->
* Measurement invariance

### Modeling different types of Data correctly
* Continuous variables
* Ordinal variables
* Joint ordinal & continuous variables Contingency tables
* Gaussian Copulas
* Polychoric/Polyserial correlations
* Raw data
* Weighted least squares

### Modeling predictors, effects, definition variables, weights, missingness correctly
* Extracting means, covariances, and thresholds
* Exogenous predictors
* Definition variables
* Fixed & random effects
* Sample weights
* Missing data
* Missing at random
* Non-ignorable missingness

### How do I simulate data, power...
* Simulations
* Power analysis
* [Meta analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaSEM/vignettes/Examples.html)
* Multiple group analysis

### Twin Models
* umx includes many twin models including ACE, ACEv, simplex, sex-limitation, GxE, common pathway, independent pathway, etc.
* ACE / ADE
* Univariate / Multivariate
* Sex limitation
* GxE interaction
* Direction of causation
* Two-stage Twin family models
* Assortative mating models
* Extended pedigree models
* Niche selection

### GREML and genomic SEM
* Molecular genetic variance component analysis
* Genomic Relatedness Matrix
* Restricted Maximum Likelihood

### Parameter estimates and fit statistics
* Goodness-of-fit
* Getting chi-squared statistics with mxRefModels

* Using mxMI for model modification Bootstrapping
* Robust Standard Errors
* Factor Scores
* Jack-knifing
* Cross-validation
* Modification indices with umxMI
* Bootstrap Likelihood ratio tests

### How do I add covariates, different intervals for growth...
* Fixed ages for all participants
* Variable ages or assessment intervals for all participants
* Data harmonization

### How to pick starting values
 * Leave them at zero
 * Make an educated guess
 * Use mxAutoStart
 * Error Status Codes
### How to modify Graphical output
  * How do I plot results?
