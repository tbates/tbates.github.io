<p style="text-align: center;">This is a page of example models. To learn about installing click here, to learn about path-based model syntax click here.</p>



note: It is a new page for April 2019: If we go with this wiki as the basis for collecting all OpenMx Scripts, links will be added here.

### Three basic methods of modeling supported in OpenMx
* Path analysis
* RAM - LISREL
* Matrix algebra

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis
* One factor models
* Multiple factor models
* Ordinal factor analysis
* Joint ordinal/continuous factor analysis

### SEM, indirect effects, mediation analysis
* Regression with structural equation models
* Ordinal regression
* Mediation and why not to use it: Hunter

### Measurement models and Psychometrics
* Item response theory
* Item factor analysis
* Measurement invariance
* Differential item functioning
* Test equating

### Multiple groups
* Raw data
* Weighted least squares
* Extracting means, covariances, and thresholds

### Growth and change
* Latent growth model
* Latent growth mixture model
* Regime switching model
* Independent mixture model

* Factor mixture model
* Dynamical systems analysis
* Latent differential equations

### Multilevel SEM
* Multilevel regression models

### Modeling different types of Data correctly
* Continuous variables
* Ordinal variables

### Twin Models
* umx includes many twin models including ACE, ACEv, simplex, sex-limitation, GxE, common pathway, independent pathway, etc.
* ACE / ADE
* Univariate / Multivariate
* Sex limitation
* GxE interaction
