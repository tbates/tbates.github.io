<p style="text-align: center;">"Principles keep practice aligned with goals"</p>

This package has one principle: make good modeling easier.

`umx` provides a compact set of functions to support four core tasks:

1. Express theories in SEM models.
2. Test competing theories.
3. Maintain a reproducible workflow.
4. Communicate results effectively.

OpenMx is a fantastic base - often you'll stick with core OpenMx functions: Using `mxPath` instead of `umxPath`, or `summary` instead of `umxSummary`.

That said, R has too many cases where "*you can do it lots of ways*". We want `umx` to provide "just one way" that makes basic work easy, and complex work manageable, so you can spend more time doing better science.

That's it ☺ On to the modeling!
